This contains different files representing a certain frame after snap to show different time periods of a play. All files contain SNAP data.
For example, after_snap_n contains pairs of SNAP data, and data 10n frames after the snap of each play that lasted at least 10n frames. Due to this after_snap_16 is very small.
